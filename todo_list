System successfully incorporated:
- Bose Hubbard
- Fermi Hubbard
- Full Heisenberg model (incl. xyz's, ising etc)


TO DO: (by order of importance)
- Kondo Model
- Anderson/Anderson Impurity Model
- t-J model
- Wigner Transformed Ising Model in the fermions basis !! care does not conserve total nr of fermions. check literature

Classical spin lattice sim:
- Pott's Model
- Ising (metropolis)
- General Percolation
- XY model
